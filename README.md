# summer_22_ugrad_project
MATLAB code files and videos for my undergraduate research project completed Summer 2022 with Professor Addington in the University of Oregon Math Department. Supported by NSF grant no. DMS-2039316.

The videos show a conic fibration on a cubic surface by taking a line which lies in the cubic surface and considering the planes which contain the same line. Then, the intersection of the plane and the cubic surface is a conic - either a circle, ellipse, parabola, hyperbola, or (occasionally) a pair of lines. 

A more detailed explanation can be found on Prof. Addington's website at https://pages.uoregon.edu/adding/videos/
